    <string name="content">Right now, there are people all over the world who are just like you. They\'re either lonely, they\'re missing somebody, they\'re depressed, they\'re hurt, they\'re scarred from the past, they\'re having personal issues no one knows about, they have secrets you wouldn\'t believe. They wish, they dream and they hope. And right now, they are sitting here reading these words, and I\'m writing this for you so you dont feel alone anymore. Always remember, don\'t be depressed about the past, don\'t worry about the future, and just focus on today. If today\'s not so great don\'t worry! Tomorrow\'s a new chance. If you are reading this, be sure to share this around to make others feel better. Have a nice day!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/</string>
